# MNIST_PCA_with_SVM
Using MNIST data in Google COLAB to train a SVM model dealing with PCA data.  
In this code,I take first 100 singular values of convarience matrix's SVD transformation and training with two layer SVM.  
The result of this code shows PCA makes the model more robust to overfitting.
